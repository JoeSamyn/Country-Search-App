# Country-Search-App
Country Search App was a school project written in java.  The program reads in a csv file called countries.csv.  Its sorts all of the different values into their proper variables within an object called countries.

1. Median Population of Planet (Uses bubble sort and Binary Search)

6. All Info of A Country Search By Array ID (Direct Address Method)
7. All Countries Info Search By Country Code (Binary Search);
